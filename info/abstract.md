Eye disease recognition plays a pivotal role in early diagnosis and treatment, contributing to the preservation of vision and overall eye health. In this project, we present a novel framework for automated ocular disease recognition leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed methodology encompasses several key stages: dataset acquisition and preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation. We assembled a comprehensive dataset comprising images of various ocular diseases, encompassing conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, macular degeneration, and others. Through meticulous preprocessing, including image normalization and augmentation, we prepared the dataset to facilitate robust model training. Central to our approach is the design of a CNN architecture tailored for ocular disease recognition. By exploiting the hierarchical feature learning capabilities of CNNs, our model extracts discriminative features from input images, enabling accurate classification of different ocular diseases. We fine-tune the model using transfer learning techniques, starting from a pre-trained CNN architecture to enhance performance even with limited labeled data. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments, including cross-validation and performance benchmarking. Our results showcase the superiority of the proposed CNN-based framework in accurately identifying various ocular diseases compared to traditional methods.
